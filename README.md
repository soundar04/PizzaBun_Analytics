🍕 Customer Service Dashboard Project | Pizza Bun 🍕

I had the incredible opportunity to design and develop a dynamic Customer Service Dashboard for Pizza Bun, a unique pizza shop known for its bun-crust pizzas! After their first year of operations, the business needed to regroup and gain clarity on how their customer service was performing—and I stepped in to transform raw data into meaningful insights. 📊✨

🔍 Data Journey: From Chaos to Clarity
The dataset was massive and full of inconsistencies—dirty, missing, and disorganized data. Here's how I tackled it:

🧹 Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, corrected missing values, and restructured the customer service data into a reliable, clean table.
✅ Data Validation: Ensured the accuracy and integrity of the data, making it a trusted source for analysis.
🧠 Business Logic: Mapped out crucial metrics like customer satisfaction (C-Sat) scores and linked them to agents, contact types, and specific timeframes to bring clarity to the data.
📊 Answering Key Business Questions with Pivot Tables
Using advanced pivot tables, I answered six critical business questions, and each one was converted into meaningful visual charts for easy interpretation. The dashboard showcases:

⭐ C-Sat Scores by Agent & Contact Type: Helping the business identify top-performing agents and better understand what drives customer satisfaction.
📈 Interaction Volume Insights: Visualizing the number of interactions per agent and contact type to highlight busy periods and service bottlenecks.
🗓️ Day-Wise Trend Analysis: Displaying customer satisfaction trends and interaction volumes, helping the business track performance over time.
🎨 Interactive Dashboard Design
I created a visually appealing and user-friendly dashboard that brings the data to life:

📊 Engaging Visuals: Bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs make it easy to spot trends and patterns at a glance.
⏳ Interactive Timeline Slicer: Allows stakeholders to filter and zoom in on specific periods, providing flexibility in exploring customer interactions over time.
👥 Comparative Insights: Offers side-by-side comparisons of agent performance, empowering the team to make data-driven decisions about resource allocation and agent training.
🚀 Impact on Business:
The dashboard delivers actionable insights that help Pizza Bun:

⚡ Enhance Customer Service: By identifying key trends in complaints, requests, and queries, the team can respond faster and more effectively.
🔝 Boost Agent Productivity: By highlighting top performers and areas for improvement, managers can make informed decisions to optimize team performance.
